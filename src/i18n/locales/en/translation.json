This means that your company reports the VAT directly to the respective tax office.\n\nIn detail:\n- Our services are provided in Georgia, so no VAT is applicable for customers in D-A-CH. We pay our taxes in accordance with Georgian law.\n- For business customers (B2B) in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, the reverse-charge mechanism typically applies: You, as the recipient of the service, calculate the VAT yourself and remit it to the respective tax office. At the same time, you can usually claim it back as input tax, resulting in no actual tax burden.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us directly."
